    "# Simulating Vibratory Systems with Non-Linearities\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore numerically simulating the motion of **non-linear** systems for which we can't (or can't easily) derive the exact solutions analytically. After completing the notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Manipulate second-order differential equations (equations of motion) to obtain corresponding *systems of first-order differential equations*\n",
    "- Become familiar with the programming interface for numerically integrating systems of first-order ODEs\n",
    "- Simulate the free response of systems with non-linear characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Systems of First-Order ODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate non-linear vibratory systems, we manipulate the equation(s) of motion into a specific form that allows generic numerical integration routines to work. This is achieved by selecting *state variables* for which we can write first-order ODEs corresponding to the equations of motion. That is, the goal is to write a system of first-order differential equations of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align} \\dot{x}_1 &= f(x_1,\\, x_2,\\, \\ldots) \\\\ \\dot{x}_2 &= g(x_1,\\, x_2,\\, \\ldots) \\\\ \\vdots \\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we derive the equations of motion using the Newton-Euler method, we get second-order differential equations. For one-dimensional motion, a simple choice of variables is $x_1 = x$ (position) and $x_2 = \\dot{x}$ (velocity). Then we get $\\dot{x}_1 = x_2$ and $\\dot{x}_2 = \\ddot{x}$, so we can write our system of equations as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align} \\dot{x}_1 &= x_2 \\\\ \\dot{x}_2 &= \\frac{1}{m} \\sum F \\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first equation is trivial (because of our selection of state variables), and the second equation is just $F = ma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerically Integrating First-Order ODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "In our code, we define a Python function that takes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the current values of our state variables ($x_1,\\, x_2,\\, \\ldots$) in an array\n",
    "- the current time value\n",
    "- (optional) additional parameters such as masses, spring constants, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function uses these inputs to compute the derivatives of the state variables $\\left(\\dot{x}_1(t),\\,\\dot{x}_2(t),\\,\\ldots)\\right)$ and return them. This function is passed to an ordinary differential equation solver with the initial conditions and an array of time values, and the solver repeatedly runs our function and numerically integrates to evaulate the state variables at the requested time points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Linear mass-spring-damper system\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's simulate the mass-spring-damper system with linear spring and damping elements. The equation of motion is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m\\ddot{x} + c\\dot{x} + k x = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're dealing with 1D motion, our selection of state variables is straightforward: $x$ (position) and $v = \\dot{x}$ (velocity). In this case, our state equations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align} \\dot{x} &= v \\\\ \\dot{v} &= -\\frac{k}{m}x - \\frac{c}{m} v \\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
